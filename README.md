This is a mini 386-based OS I wrote long ago, in C and NASM.

It runs on a floppy disk (in virtual machines or real 386 computers).

Runnable image release is provided, with Bochs config.

compiling
---------

You will need NASM and gcc, together with GNU automake.

Notice that the sources MUST compile to ELF format, so building on windows is currently not supported.
